# Understanding the Factors Influencing STD Prevalance
**NOTE: I am currently restructuring this repo to improve readability and ease of use. Please check back on 10/30/19**

In this repository is the data analysis our group performed for the [2019 Stanford Blueprint Datathon](https://blueprint-datathon.weebly.com/about.html), a weekend-long hackathon focusing on data science in healthcare. Although this was our first foray into the world of data science, our team placed amongst the top 4 teams for the competition. Our [final presentation](Datathon_Presentation.pdf) is attached for those interested. The [original case information](blueprint-case.pdf) is also included.

Completed by Yiran Liu, Quenton Bubb, Sai Gourisankar, Jeremy Binagia.
